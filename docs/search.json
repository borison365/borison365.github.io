    "text": "Infectious disease dynamics\n\nSimulation of the Kermack and McKendrick SIR model of influenza\n\nThe graph below represents an SIR model simulation of an influenza outbreak over 160 days. The three curves show the population of Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) individuals.\n\nThe black dashed line shows the rapid decline in the susceptible population as the infection spreads.\nThe red line shows the peak of infection occurring around day 20, followed by a steep drop as individuals recover.\nThe blue dotted line represents the growth of the recovered population as more individuals recover and gain immunity over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Parameters:\n\nTransmission Rate (β): In this case, β = 1.28, which represents how many people an infected person transmits the disease to per day. It is tied to the basic reproductive number (R₀), which is a crucial measure in epidemiology. The value of R₀ is calculated as:\nR₀​=β​/γ\nwhere γ is the recovery rate. R₀ tells us how many people one infected person will, on average, spread the disease to in a fully susceptible population. In this example, γ = 1/7 (1 recovery every 7 days). Thus, R₀ in this scenario is approximately 8.96, suggesting a highly contagious disease.\nRecovery Rate (γ): This parameter indicates how quickly infected individuals recover. A γ value of 1/7 means it takes an average of 7 days for an infected person to recover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulation of the COVID 19 SEIR model, including vaccination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SEIRV model simulates the spread of COVID-19 by categorizing individuals into five groups:\n\nSusceptible (S): Uninfected and unvaccinated individuals.\nExposed (E): Infected but not yet contagious individuals.\nInfected (I): Actively infectious individuals.\nRecovered (R): Those who recovered from the disease and gained immunity.\nVaccinated (V): Individuals who received the vaccine, reducing their susceptibility.\n\nThis model demonstrates the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission over time and highlights how vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the spread of the virus. It takes into account incubation periods, infection rates, and vaccination efforts, making it a useful tool for understanding epidemic behavior and predicting outcomes based on intervention strategies.\n\nStochastic Malaria Transmission Model (Human-Mosquito Dynamics)\n\n\nThis graph visualizes malaria transmission dynamics in an endemic area. It shows three populations over time:\n\nInfected Humans (red line): Peaks as malaria spreads, then declines as individuals recover.\nRecovered Humans (blue line): Grows steadily as infected individuals recover.\nMosquito Population (green line, secondary axis): Reflects seasonal variations, with a surge during the rainy season (days 50-150), leading to increased mosquito birth and malaria transmission.\n\nThis model simulates the interactions between humans and mosquitoes in an endemic malaria scenario.\nThe stochastic component is reflected in the randomness of mosquito population growth and human infection dynamics. The model uses twin axes to show human populations (infected and recovered) and mosquito population dynamics, including seasonal mosquito birth during the rainy season. This approach captures the inherent randomness in disease transmission and mosquito reproduction, making it more realistic for real-world applications."
