# **Infectious disease dynamics**

**A- Workshop 1**

1\. Simulation of the **Kermack and McKendrick** SIR model of influenza

The graph below represents an **SIR model** simulation of an influenza outbreak over 160 days. The three curves show the population of **Susceptible (S)**, **Infected (I)**, and **Recovered (R)** individuals.

-   The **black dashed line** shows the rapid decline in the susceptible population as the infection spreads.

-   The **red line** shows the peak of infection occurring around day 20, followed by a steep drop as individuals recover.

-   The **blue dotted line** represents the growth of the recovered population as more individuals recover and gain immunity over time.

### Key Parameters:

1.  **Transmission Rate (β)**: In this case, β = 1.28, which represents how many people an infected person transmits the disease to per day. It is tied to the **basic reproductive number (R₀)**, which is a crucial measure in epidemiology. The value of **R₀** is calculated as:

    R₀​=β​/γ

    where **γ** is the recovery rate. **R₀** tells us how many people one infected person will, on average, spread the disease to in a fully susceptible population. In this example, **γ = 1/7** (1 recovery every 7 days). Thus, **R₀** in this scenario is approximately 8.96, suggesting a highly contagious disease.

2.  **Recovery Rate (γ)**: This parameter indicates how quickly infected individuals recover. A **γ** value of 1/7 means it takes an average of 7 days for an infected person to recover.

2.  **Simulation of the COVID 19 SEIR model, including vaccination**

![](images/COVID%2019_SEIRV_model.png){fig-align="center"}

The **SEIRV model** simulates the spread of COVID-19 by categorizing individuals into five groups:

-   **Susceptible (S)**: Uninfected and unvaccinated individuals.

-   **Exposed (E)**: Infected but not yet contagious individuals.

-   **Infected (I)**: Actively infectious individuals.

-   **Recovered (R)**: Those who recovered from the disease and gained immunity.

-   **Vaccinated (V)**: Individuals who received the vaccine, reducing their susceptibility.

This model demonstrates the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission over time and highlights how vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the spread of the virus. It takes into account **incubation periods**, infection rates, and vaccination efforts, making it a useful tool for understanding epidemic behavior and predicting outcomes based on intervention strategies.

3.  **Stochastic Malaria Transmission Model (Human-Mosquito Dynamics)**

![](images/malaria_model.png)

This graph visualizes malaria transmission dynamics in an endemic area. It shows three populations over time:

1.  **Infected Humans** (red line): Peaks as malaria spreads, then declines as individuals recover.

2.  **Recovered Humans** (blue line): Grows steadily as infected individuals recover.

3.  **Mosquito Population** (green line, secondary axis): Reflects seasonal variations, with a surge during the rainy season (days 50-150), leading to increased mosquito birth and malaria transmission.

    -   This model simulates the interactions between humans and mosquitoes in an endemic malaria scenario.

    -   The **stochastic component** is reflected in the randomness of mosquito population growth and human infection dynamics. The model uses **twin axes** to show **human populations** (infected and recovered) and **mosquito population** dynamics, including seasonal mosquito birth during the rainy season. This approach captures the inherent randomness in disease transmission and mosquito reproduction, making it more realistic for real-world applications.
