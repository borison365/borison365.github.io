# **I. Infectious disease dynamics**

**A- Workshop 1**

In a workshop I participated in mathematical modeling, we:

1\. Simulated the **Kermack and McKendrick** SIR model of influenza

The graph below represents an **SIR model** simulation of an influenza outbreak over 160 days. The three curves show the population of **Susceptible (S)**, **Infected (I)**, and **Recovered (R)** individuals.

-   The **black dashed line** shows the rapid decline in the susceptible population as the infection spreads.

-   The **red line** shows the peak of infection occurring around day 20, followed by a steep drop as individuals recover.

-   The **blue dotted line** represents the growth of the recovered population as more individuals recover and gain immunity over time.

### Key Parameters:

1.  **Transmission Rate (β)**: In this case, β = 1.28, which represents how many people an infected person transmits the disease to per day. It is tied to the **basic reproductive number (R₀)**, which is a crucial measure in epidemiology. The value of **R₀** is calculated as:

    R₀​=β​/γ

    where **γ** is the recovery rate. **R₀** tells us how many people one infected person will, on average, spread the disease to in a fully susceptible population. In this example, **γ = 1/7** (1 recovery every 7 days). Thus, **R₀** in this scenario is approximately 8.96, suggesting a highly contagious disease.

2.  **Recovery Rate (γ)**: This parameter indicates how quickly infected individuals recover. A **γ** value of 1/7 means it takes an average of 7 days for an infected person to recover.

2.  **Simulation of the COVID 19 SEIR model, including vaccination**

![](images/COVID%2019_SEIRV_model.png){fig-align="center"}

The **SEIRV model** simulates the spread of COVID-19 by categorizing individuals into five groups:

-   **Susceptible (S)**: Uninfected and unvaccinated individuals.

-   **Exposed (E)**: Infected but not yet contagious individuals.

-   **Infected (I)**: Actively infectious individuals.

-   **Recovered (R)**: Those who recovered from the disease and gained immunity.

-   **Vaccinated (V)**: Individuals who received the vaccine, reducing their susceptibility.

This model demonstrates the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission over time and highlights how vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the spread of the virus. It takes into account **incubation periods**, infection rates, and vaccination efforts, making it a useful tool for understanding epidemic behavior and predicting outcomes based on intervention strategies.

3.  **Stochastic Malaria Transmission Model (Human-Mosquito Dynamics)**

![](images/malaria_model.png)

This graph visualizes malaria transmission dynamics in an endemic area. It shows three populations over time:

1.  **Infected Humans** (red line): Peaks as malaria spreads, then declines as individuals recover.

2.  **Recovered Humans** (blue line): Grows steadily as infected individuals recover.

3.  **Mosquito Population** (green line, secondary axis): Reflects seasonal variations, with a surge during the rainy season (days 50-150), leading to increased mosquito birth and malaria transmission.

    -   This model simulates the interactions between humans and mosquitoes in an endemic malaria scenario.

    -   The **stochastic component** is reflected in the randomness of mosquito population growth and human infection dynamics. The model uses **twin axes** to show **human populations** (infected and recovered) and **mosquito population** dynamics, including seasonal mosquito birth during the rainy season. This approach captures the inherent randomness in disease transmission and mosquito reproduction, making it more realistic for real-world applications.

**B - Work shop 2**

-   In this second session I was introduced to designing models using the modeling tool Beckely Madonna

    -   Below is a simulated outbreak of an epidemic its dynamics.

## III. Bioinformatics project

##  Objective

This study aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota in the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using transgenic mouse models, focusing on shifts in microbial diversity and composition over time.

#### Study Design and Sample Collection

-   **Subjects**: A total of 12 mice were used, comprising 6 transgenic Alzheimer’s mice (3xTg-AD) and 6 wild-type (WT) controls.

-   **Sampling Time Points**: Fecal samples were collected at three distinct intervals: 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months of age, resulting in a total of 36 samples across both groups.

#### Methodology

1.  **Shotgun Sequencing**

    -   **Platform**: Illumina NextSeq 500/550 was used for high-throughput shotgun metagenomic sequencing, providing comprehensive microbial profiles of the collected fecal samples.

2.  **Sequence Quality Control**

    -   **Software**: MultiQC was employed to assess and ensure the quality of sequencing data, allowing for the identification and removal of low-quality reads.

3.  **Sequence Alignment and Host DNA Removal**

    -   **Software**: Bowtie2 was used to align sequences to a reference genome, enabling the exclusion of host (mouse) DNA and isolating microbial reads for further analysis.

4.  **Taxonomic Profiling**

    -   **Software**: MetaPhlAn 4 was utilized for taxonomic profiling, providing high-resolution identification of microbial taxa present in each sample.

5.  **Diversity Analysis**

    -   **Software**: MicrobiomeAnalyst facilitated the comparative analysis of microbial diversity, specifically targeting alpha (within-sample) and beta (between-sample) diversity.

#### Results

-   **Comparative Analysis of Microbiome Diversity**

    -   Pairwise comparisons of microbiome diversity were conducted between the following time points: 2 months vs. 6 months, 2 months vs. 12 months, and 6 months vs. 12 months.

    -   **Key Findings**: Significant differences in microbiome diversity were observed only in the Alzheimer’s (3xTg-AD) group between the 2-month and 12-month samples. No significant diversity changes were detected between these time points in the wild-type control group, nor in comparisons between 2 and 6 months or 6 and 12 months for either group.

#### Conclusion

-   The observed significant shift in microbiome diversity over time in the Alzheimer’s model, particularly between 2 and 12 months, suggests a potential association between gut microbial composition and the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease.

-   These findings highlight the importance of longitudinal microbiome analysis in transgenic models and may contribute to identifying microbial markers linked to neurodegenerative disease progression.

-   Future studies could further investigate the specific bacterial taxa responsible for these differences, potentially paving the way for microbiome-based therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer’s Disease.
