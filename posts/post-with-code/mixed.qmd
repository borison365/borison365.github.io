We used the dataset Orthodont to perferm our analysis with **repeated variables**...

        ** Interpreting the model**
```

The `lme` function fits a linear mixed-effects model with `distance` as the response variable, `age` and `Sex` as fixed effects, and random intercepts and slopes (age) for each subject. The interaction term `age * Sex` allows for the possibility that the effect of age on distance might differ between males and females.

This plot shows the observed data points and the fitted lines from the mixed-effects model, with different colors representing different sexes.
